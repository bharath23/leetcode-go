Simple two pass solution. For each node in listA compare with each node in
listB. If they are equal return the node. Time complexity is o(n^2), worst
case you have to visit each node. Space complexity is O(1) as there is no
additional space requrired.

Complexity:
Time complexity: O(n^2)
Space complexity: O(1)

Simple one pass soluation using hash map. Visit each node of listA and add it
