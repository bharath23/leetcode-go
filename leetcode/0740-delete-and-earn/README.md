#### Delete and Earn
You are given an integer array `nums`. You want to maximize the number of points you get by performing the following operation any number of times:

* Pick any `nums[i]` and delete it to earn `nums[i]` points. Afterwards, you must delete every element equal to `nums[i] - 1` and every element equal to `nums[i] + 1`.

Return _the **maximum number of points** you can earn by applying the above operation some number of times_.

**Example 1**:
<pre><code><b>Input</b>: nums = [3, 4, 2]
<b>Output</b>: 6
<b>Explanation</b>: You can perform the following operations:
- Delete 4 to earn 4 points. Consequently, 3 is also deleted. nums = [2].
- Delete 2 to earn 2 points. nums = []
You earn a total of 6 points
</code></pre>

**Example 2**:
<pre><code><b>Input</b>: [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]
<b>Output</b>: 9
<b>Explanation</b>: You can perform the following operations:
- Delete 3 to earn 3 points. All 2's and 4's are also deleted. nums = [3, 3].
- Delete 3 again to earn 3 points. nums = [3]
- Delete 3 once more to earn 3 points. nums = []
You earn a total of 9 points.
</code></pre>

**Constraints**:
* <code>1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10<sup>4</sup></code>
* <code>1 <= nums[i] <= 10<sup4</sup></code>
